#Complete Angular Udemy Tutorial

This app uses bootstrap which is included in angular.json config file in architect>build>styles

We show a single page from the html file "index.html", which renders <app-root></app-root>
App root is actually the root NG module app.module.ts which is bootstrapped in (not really accurate, but we'll get there)
The structure goes like this
    index.html
        app.component.html
            servers.component.html
                server.component.html

Of course it's a work in progress since we're halfway through the course.
